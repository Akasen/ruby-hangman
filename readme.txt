This is a hangman project that was being made for The Odin Project as part of one of its projects

Nearly everything about the game works, except for the saving and loading aspects.

Admittedly, I didn't have the foresight to work in a proper means of parsing player input.
At the time of this writing, I have spent potentially two weeks working on this project and a week
figuring out data serialization without any real means to practice for it.
While this project would make a good practice, at this moment, I'm dealing with a battle with
potentially poor decisions on my part that are now holding me back.

In the interest of progress then, this project will be abandoned until further notice as I choose to
make my move into the next section of the The Odin Project for the sake of time and progress.
